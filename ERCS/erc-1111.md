## Abstract

[ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md), known as the Unified Token Standard, introduces a comprehensive protocol unifying the characteristics of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard seamlessly integrates the liquidity features of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) with the non-fungible nature of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), enabling frictionless conversion between these asset types. [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) offers a multifunctional solution, providing developers and users with the flexibility to leverage both liquidity and non-fungibility in a unified token framework.


## Motivation

The motivation behind [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) stems from the inherent need within the blockchain community for assets that possess both the liquidity of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens and the non-fungibility of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens. Current standards present a dichotomy, necessitating users to choose between these features. [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) addresses this limitation by providing a unified token standard, empowering users to seamlessly transition between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) characteristics, catering to diverse blockchain applications.

## Specification

- [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) standardizes a token contract that encompasses features from both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md).
- The token contract supports state transitions between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes, ensuring smooth conversion and utilization of both liquidity and non-fungibility.
- Defines essential functions and events to support token interactions, conversions, and queries.
- Implements a low gas consumption [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) mode to maintain gas efficiency comparable to typical [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token transfers.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following Solidity interface:

## Rationale

The rationale for [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) lies in its ability to harmonize liquidity and non-fungibility, filling a crucial gap in the existing token standards. By unifying ERC-20 and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) features, [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) enhances user flexibility, allowing for efficient conversion between these asset types. The protocol is designed to provide a standardized and versatile solution for developers, promoting a more streamlined development process. With smooth transitions and low gas consumption, [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) aims to be a robust standard that not only simplifies token interactions but also fosters broader adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility


The proposed [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) introduces a challenge in terms of backward compatibility due to the distinct balance query mechanisms utilized by ERC-20 and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standards. [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) employs balanceOf to check an account's token balance, while [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) uses balanceOf to inquire about the quantity of tokens owned by an account. To reconcile these differences, the ERC must consider providing either two separate functions catering to each standard or adopting a more generalized approach.

### Compatibility Points

The primary compatibility point lies in the discrepancy between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)'s balanceOf and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)'s balanceOf functionalities. Developers accustomed to the specific balance query methods in each standard may face challenges when transitioning to [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md).

### Proposed Solutions

Dual Balance Query Functions:

Introduce two distinct functions, erc20BalanceOf and erc721TotalSupply, to align with the conventions of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), respectively. Developers can choose the function based on the token type they are working with.

## Test Cases


## Reference Implementation

- [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) standard undergoes thorough testing to ensure consistent and accurate behavior in both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes.
- Detailed documentation and sample code are provided to assist developers in understanding and implementing the [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md) standard.

## Security Considerations

- Due to the dual nature of [ERC-1111](./eip-1111.md), potential differences in protocol interpretation may arise, necessitating careful consideration during development.
- Comprehensive security audits are recommended, especially during mode transitions by users, to ensure the safety of user assets.

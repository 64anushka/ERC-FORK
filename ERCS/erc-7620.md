## Abstract

This EIP proposes a decentralized mechanism for users to pre-authorize specific service providers to deduct funds from their accounts without requiring explicit approval for each transaction. It aims to improve transaction efficiency and user experience in DApps and services by defining a smart contract interface that allows users to safely pre-authorize [ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) token transfers to registered service providers. Utilizing this protocol, a decentralized registry of service providers can be created, where providers can register and deregister themselves, and users can dynamically grant and revoke authorizations based on trust.

## Motivation

In the current Ethereum ecosystem, users need to confirm every transaction when transferring funds to third parties, which can be inconvenient, especially for services requiring frequent micro-payments. By implementing a decentralized pre-authorized fund deduction protocol, this process can be significantly streamlined while retaining full control for users over their funds.

## Specification

The protocol specifies the following key functionalities:

- `registerServiceProvider(address serviceProvider)`: Allows service providers to register themselves.
- `deregisterServiceProvider(address serviceProvider)`: Allows service providers to deregister themselves.
- `authorizeServiceProvider(address serviceProvider, uint256 amount)`: Allows users to pre-authorize a specified amount of tokens to a service provider.
- `revokeAuthorization(address serviceProvider)`: Allows users to revoke the pre-authorization given to a service provider.
- `deductFunds(address user, uint256 amount)`: Enables service providers to deduct funds from a user's account based on the authorization.

## Rationale

The rationale behind the Pre-Authorized Fund Deduction Protocol is to provide a flexible, secure, and efficient method of enabling automated transactions between users and service providers within the Ethereum ecosystem. By allowing users to pre-authorize service providers, we reduce transaction friction and improve the overall user experience in decentralized finance (DeFi) and other DApp interactions.

## Reference Implementation

See [`ERC7620.sol`](../assets/eip-7620/contracts/ERC7620.sol).

## Security Considerations

The protocol should ensure all operations have proper security checks to prevent unauthorized fund transfers. The registration and deregistration of service providers should be logged and monitored to prevent abuse. Smart contracts implementing this protocol must carefully manage permissions and enforce strict checks on service provider registrations and fund deductions.

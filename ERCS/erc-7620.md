## Abstract

This EIP proposes a decentralized mechanism enabling users to pre-authorize specific service providers to deduct funds from their accounts without requiring explicit approval for each transaction. It aims to enhance transaction efficiency and user experience in DApps and services by defining a smart contract interface that safely enables users to pre-authorize [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token transfers to registered service providers. By utilizing this protocol, a decentralized registry of service providers can be established, where providers can register and deregister themselves, and users can dynamically grant and revoke authorizations based on trust.

## Motivation

In the current Ethereum ecosystem, users encounter the inconvenience of needing to manually confirm each transaction when transferring funds to third parties. This becomes particularly cumbersome for services necessitating frequent micro-payments. Additionally, in certain DApps, there's a desire to obtain user fund authorizations without relying on ERC-20's `approve` method. This reluctance stems from the fact that `approve` does not involve placing funds in a trusted third-party entity.

To address this concern, there's a proposal to introduce a third-party contract capable of receiving and managing authorized funds. These third-party entities could include reputable organizations, such as charities or authoritative institutions. By channeling authorized funds into a dedicated pool, these entities could generate charitable returns or facilitate community benefits.

Furthermore, there's potential to implement governance mechanisms, such as DAO governance or transparent public oversight, for managing the list of authorized service providers. This would enhance trust and transparency, allowing users to dynamically manage their authorizations while ensuring the integrity of the service provider ecosystem. Through these enhancements, the proposed Pre-Authorized Service Payment Protocol not only streamlines transaction processes but also fosters trust, transparency, and community engagement within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC7620 {
    // Events

    /**
     * @dev Event emitted when a service provider is registered.
     * @param serviceProvider The address of the registered service provider.
     */
    event ServiceProviderRegistered(address serviceProvider);

    /**
     * @dev Event emitted when a service provider is deregistered.
     * @param serviceProvider The address of the deregistered service provider.
     */
    event ServiceProviderDeregistered(address serviceProvider);

    /**
     * @dev Event emitted when authorization amount is updated.
     * @param user The address of the user whose authorization is updated.
     * @param serviceProvider The address of the service provider.
     * @param newAuthorizedAmount The new authorized amount.
     */

     * @param user The address of the user from whom funds are deducted.
     * @param serviceProvider The address of the service provider.

     */
    event AuthorizationRevoked(address indexed user, address indexed serviceProvider);

    /**

     * @param user The address of the user who withdrew funds.
     * @param amount The amount of funds withdrawn.

     * @param user The address of the user from whom funds will be deducted.

     * @param user The address of the user.
     * @param serviceProvider The address of the service provider.
     * @return The authorized amount.
     */
    function authorizedAmount(address user, address serviceProvider) external view returns (uint256);

     * @param serviceProvider The address of the service provider to check.
     * @return True if the service provider is registered, otherwise false.
     */

## Rationale

The primary motivation behind the Pre-Authorized Service Payment Protocol stems from the need for a more efficient and secure transaction mechanism between users and service providers within the Ethereum blockchain. While ERC-20's `approve` method provides a means to authorize fund usage, there's a recognition that the authorized funds could be put to better use.

By introducing this protocol, the aim is to optimize the utilization of authorized funds, ensuring that they serve a meaningful purpose beyond mere approval. This not only streamlines the transaction process but also maximizes the utility of authorized funds, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Reference Implementation

See [`ERC7620.sol`](../assets/eip-7620/contracts/ERC7620.sol).

## Security Considerations

The protocol includes several security measures to ensure the safety of user funds and the integrity of service provider transactions. These measures include checks for service provider registration, user authorization levels, and transaction limits. Implementations of this protocol must rigorously enforce these security checks to prevent unauthorized fund deductions and protect against potential abuses.

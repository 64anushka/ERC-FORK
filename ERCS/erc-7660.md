## Abstract

This proposal outlines [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens which released based on predefined periods,it uses a novel "Sorter" mechanism in this protocol, which automatically consolidates multiple transfers in smart contracts. This feature ensures token release based on different transfer times while minimizing gas fees significantly.

## Motivation

Rely on this new standard to establish a Token category with a consensus period by default (passive), rather than the motivation and means of linear release (subjective).

## Specification

### Interface

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC7660 {

    // Struct

     struct VestInfo {
        uint256 total;
        uint256 released;
        uint256 startTime;
      }
    
    // Events

    /**
     * @dev Event emitted when a message is sent.
     * @param sender The address of the sender will exclude vesting or not.
     * @param flag  The flag whether the sender address will exclude vesting or not;
     */
     event SetExcludedVest(address sender,bool flag);
     
    /**
     * @dev Event emitted when a message is sent.
     * @param sender The address of the uniswap Router will exclude vesting or not.
     * @param flag  The flag whether the uniswap Router will exclude vesting or not;
     */ 
      event SetSwapRouter(address sender,address swapRouter, bool flag);

    // Functions

    /**
     * @dev Function to get a user's Linear Release token info.
     * @param account The address of the user.
     * @return total The total token will be released in the period.
     * @return canRelease The current will be released token in the period.
     * @return released The token has be released in the period.
     */
    function getCanReleaseInfo(address account) public view returns (uint256 total, uint256 canRelease, uint256 released);

    /**
     * @dev Function to claim the user's released token to the account.
     * @param account The address of the user.
     */
    function claimRelease(address account) external;
     
    /**
     * @dev Function to set the accout for exclude vesting.
     * @param account The address of the sender will exclude vesting or not.
     * @param flag  The flag whether the sender address will exclude vesting or not.
     */
    function setExcludedVest(address account,bool flag) external; 
    
    /**
     * @dev Function to set the uniswap Router address which will receive token without vesting.
     * @param swapRouter The address of the uniswap router.
     * @param flag  The flag whether the router address will exclude vesting or not.
     */
    function setSwapRouter(address swapRouter, bool flag) external;

    /**
     * @dev Function to retrieve a user's vest token info in the each circle.
     * @param account The address of the user.
     * @param circleIndex The user vest token circle index.
     * @return total The total token will be released in the period for the user.
     * @return released  The token has be released in the period for the user.
     * @return startTime The token will be released at the start time .
     */
    function userVestInfo(address account,uint256 circleIndex) external view returns (uint256 total, uint256 released,uint256 startTime);
}
```

## Rationale

This standard makes the consensus period a natural attribute of the token, instead of relying on a separate smart contract to control token release. And this standard token is fully compatible with traditional ERC20 token flow scenarios.
This is more conducive to establishing a unified token consensus. The consensus period rules cannot be modified, and both developers and users accept the rules equally.
A direct [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) unlocking standard will help developers who need this scenario build a better relationship of mutual trust with the community. They can no longer make huge profits by overdrafting expected early marketing, especially for tokens with strong backgrounds. Large amounts of funds are often withdrawn from the market through clever and obscure unlocking rules, making it difficult for ordinary users to identify these traps.
In addition to the above, the consensus period will help the token complete the process from its development cycle to the community construction cycle more smoothly. They can formulate the consensus period of the token according to expectations, so that it can be unlocked simultaneously with the construction and improvement of its ecology. This is very important for Those meme coins are especially important.

## Security Considerations

- User lock period should be less than 20,if more than 20 period may need more gas.

- Users or developers should be aware of potential period Locks, where the duration and period time can be modified through protocols. Users or protocols should check the duration and period times carefully before trading or lending with others.

title: Unified Protocol for ERC-20 and ERC-721 Token Management
description: This proposal provides a unified interface for managing both ERC-20 fungible tokens and ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Currently, these tokens operate with distinct standards, complicating development for applications needing to interact with both. The unified interface standardizes common functions such as transferring, minting, burning, and querying balances and ownership, regardless of token type. This approach simplifies the development process, reduces complexity, and enhances interoperability within the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling seamless integration and management of both fungible and non-fungible tokens under a single framework.

## Abstract

This proposal introduces a protocol that provides a unified interface, IERC7629, for managing both ERC-20 fungible tokens and ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol defines a set of common functions, including transferFrom, mint, burn, balanceOf, and ownerOf, which are applicable to both token types. By standardizing these functions, developers can interact with both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens using a single, cohesive interface, simplifying integration and enhancing interoperability within decentralized applications (DApps).

At its core, the unification mechanism revolves around the design of the IERC7629 interface, which encapsulates the essential functionalities required for token management. This interface abstracts away the differences between ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, allowing developers to interact with tokens in a uniform manner. Underneath the interface, the protocol implements logic to handle token transfers, minting, burning, and ownership queries in a way that is compatible with both token standards. This approach ensures that developers can seamlessly integrate ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens into their DApps without needing to write separate code for each token type.

By providing a unified interface for managing different token types, this protocol promotes code reusability, reduces development effort, and fosters innovation in the Ethereum ecosystem. It enables developers to build more versatile and efficient DApps that leverage the unique properties of both fungible and non-fungible tokens under a single framework.


## Motivation

The motivation behind this proposal stems from the inherent need within the blockchain community for assets that possess both the liquidity of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens and the non-fungibility of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens. Current standards present a dichotomy, necessitating users to choose between these features. this proposal addresses this limitation by providing a unified token standard, empowering users to seamlessly transition between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) characteristics, catering to diverse blockchain applications.

## Specification

- this proposal standardizes a token contract that encompasses features from both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md).
- The token contract supports state transitions between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes, ensuring smooth conversion and utilization of both liquidity and non-fungibility.
- Defines essential functions and events to support token interactions, conversions, and queries.
- Implements a low gas consumption [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) mode to maintain gas efficiency comparable to typical [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token transfers.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following Solidity interface:

```
## Rationale

- Common Interface for Different Token Types:
We designed a unified interface to address the fragmentation caused by the separate ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. By standardizing functions like transferFrom, mint, and burn, we enable developers to interact with both token types without needing to implement two distinct sets of logic.

- Transfer Functionality:
The transferFrom function was included to allow the movement of tokens between addresses. We chose this function because it is a core component of both ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, ensuring seamless integration of token transfers within a single interface.

- Minting and Burning:
Including mint and burn functions allows the creation and destruction of tokens, respectively. These operations are fundamental for managing token supply and lifecycle. By incorporating these functions, we ensure that the unified interface supports complete token management workflows.

- Balance and Ownership Queries:
Functions like balanceOf and ownerOf are essential for retrieving token balances and ownership information. These functions are critical for both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens and are thus unified to provide a consistent way of accessing this data.

- Compatibility and Extensibility:
The design ensures compatibility with existing ERC-20 and ERC-721 implementations. We aimed to make the transition to a unified interface seamless, minimizing disruption. Additionally, the interface can be extended with more functions and events as needed, providing flexibility for future enhancements.

- Security Considerations:
In our design, we included mechanisms to prevent common issues such as reentrancy attacks and overflows. This is achieved through careful function implementation and adhering to best practices in smart contract development. By doing so, we ensure that the unified interface is secure and robust.



## Backwards Compatibility


The proposed this proposal introduces a challenge in terms of backward compatibility due to the distinct balance query mechanisms utilized by [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standards. [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) employs `balanceOf` to check an account's token balance, while [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) uses `balanceOf` to inquire about the quantity of tokens owned by an account. To reconcile these differences, the ERC must consider providing either two separate functions catering to each standard or adopting a more generalized approach.

### Compatibility Points

The primary compatibility point lies in the discrepancy between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)'s balanceOf and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)'s balanceOf functionalities. Developers accustomed to the specific balance query methods in each standard may face challenges when transitioning to this proposal.

### Proposed Solutions

Dual Balance Query Functions:

Introduce two distinct functions, `erc20BalanceOf` and `erc721TotalSupply`, to align with the conventions of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), respectively. Developers can choose the function based on the token type they are working with.

## Test Cases


## Reference Implementation

- this proposal standard undergoes thorough testing to ensure consistent and accurate behavior in both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes.
- Detailed documentation and sample code are provided to assist developers in understanding and implementing the this proposal standard.

## Security Considerations

- Due to the dual nature of this proposal, potential differences in protocol interpretation may arise, necessitating careful consideration during development.
- Comprehensive security audits are recommended, especially during mode transitions by users, to ensure the safety of user assets.

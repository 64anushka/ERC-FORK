## Abstract

[ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md), known as the Unified Token, introduces a comprehensive protocol unifying the characteristics of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens within the Ethereum ecosystem. This standard seamlessly integrates the liquidity features of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) with the non-fungible nature of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), enabling frictionless conversion between these asset types. [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) offers a multifunctional solution, providing developers and users with the flexibility to leverage both liquidity and non-fungibility in a unified token framework.


## Motivation

The motivation behind [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) stems from the inherent need within the blockchain community for assets that possess both the liquidity of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens and the non-fungibility of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens. Current standards present a dichotomy, necessitating users to choose between these features. [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) addresses this limitation by providing a unified token standard, empowering users to seamlessly transition between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) characteristics, catering to diverse blockchain applications.

## Specification

- [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) standardizes a token contract that encompasses features from both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md).
- The token contract supports state transitions between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes, ensuring smooth conversion and utilization of both liquidity and non-fungibility.
- Defines essential functions and events to support token interactions, conversions, and queries.
- Implements a low gas consumption [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) mode to maintain gas efficiency comparable to typical [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token transfers.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following Solidity interface:

## Rationale

The rationale for [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) lies in its ability to harmonize liquidity and non-fungibility, filling a crucial gap in the existing token standards. By unifying [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) features, [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) enhances user flexibility, allowing for efficient conversion between these asset types. The protocol is designed to provide a standardized and versatile solution for developers, promoting a more streamlined development process. With smooth transitions and low gas consumption, [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) aims to be a robust standard that not only simplifies token interactions but also fosters broader adoption within the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Backwards Compatibility


The proposed [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) introduces a challenge in terms of backward compatibility due to the distinct balance query mechanisms utilized by [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standards. [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) employs `balanceOf` to check an account's token balance, while [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) uses `balanceOf` to inquire about the quantity of tokens owned by an account. To reconcile these differences, the ERC must consider providing either two separate functions catering to each standard or adopting a more generalized approach.

### Compatibility Points

The primary compatibility point lies in the discrepancy between [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)'s balanceOf and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)'s balanceOf functionalities. Developers accustomed to the specific balance query methods in each standard may face challenges when transitioning to [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md).

### Proposed Solutions

Dual Balance Query Functions:

Introduce two distinct functions, `erc20BalanceOf` and `erc721TotalSupply`, to align with the conventions of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), respectively. Developers can choose the function based on the token type they are working with.

## Test Cases


## Reference Implementation

- [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) standard undergoes thorough testing to ensure consistent and accurate behavior in both [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) modes.
- Detailed documentation and sample code are provided to assist developers in understanding and implementing the [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md) standard.

## Security Considerations

- Due to the dual nature of [ERC-7629](./eip-7629.md), potential differences in protocol interpretation may arise, necessitating careful consideration during development.
- Comprehensive security audits are recommended, especially during mode transitions by users, to ensure the safety of user assets.

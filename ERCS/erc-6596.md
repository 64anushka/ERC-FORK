## Abstract

This EIP proposes the establishment of a comprehensive metadata standard for Cultural and Historical Asset Tokens
(CHATs) on the Ethereum platform. These tokens represent cultural and historical assets such as artwork, artifacts,
collectibles, and rare items, providing crucial context and provenance to substantiate their significance and value.

While existing NFT standards ensure the immutability and decentralized ownership of assets on the blockchain, based on
our research they do not adequately capture the cultural and historical importance and value of such assets needed for
widespread adoption by institutions such as museums. The CHAT standard aims to overcome these limitations by preserving
the provenance, history, and evolving context of cultural and historical assets, thus substantiating their value.
Furthermore, it incentivises museums, institutions, and asset owners to create tamper-proof records on the blockchain,
ensuring transparency and accountability and accelerating adoption of web3 protocols. Additionally, the CHAT standard
promotes interoperability with existing metadata standards in the arts and cultural sector, facilitating the search,
discovery, and connection of distributed assets.

## Motivation

**Preserving context and significance** - Provenance and context are crucial for cultural and historical assets. The CHAT
standard captures and preserves the provenance and history of these assets, as well as the changing contexts that emerge
from new knowledge and information. This context and provenance substantiate the significance and value of cultural and
historical assets.

**Proof-based preservation** - The recent incident of lost artifacts at the British Museum[^1] points to a need in
reassessing our current record keeping mechanisms. While existing systems mostly operate on trust, blockchain technology
offers opportunities to establish permanent and verifiable records in a proof-based environment. Introducing the CHAT
standard on the Ethereum platform enables museums, institutions, and owners of significant collections to create
tamper-proof records on the blockchain. By representing these valuable cultural and historical assets as tokens on the
blockchain, permanent and tamper-proof records can be established whenever amendments are made, ensuring greater
transparency and accountability.

**Interoperability** - The proposed standard addresses the multitude of existing metadata standards used in the arts and
cultural sector, including CDWA, CDWA-Lite, CCO, CIDOC CRM, LiDO, ISAD(G), DACS, EAD, CCDO, Getty vocabularies (AAT &
TGN), Europeana, SPECTRUM, CHIN, RAD, Dublin Core Metadata Standards, and VRA Core 4.0. The vision is to create a
metadata structure specifically built for preservation on the blockchain that is interoperable with these existing
standards and compliant with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) as well as the International Image Interoperability
Framework protocol (IIIF).

**Search and Discovery** - Ownership and history of artworks, artifacts, and historical IPs are often distributed.
Although there may never be a fully consolidated archive, a formalized blockchain-based metadata structure enables
consolidation for search and discovery of the assets, without consolidating the ownership. For example, an artifact from
an archaeological site of the Silk Road can be connected with Buddhist paintings, statues, and texts about the ancient
trade route across museum and institutional collections internationally. The proposed CHAT metadata structure will
facilitate easy access to these connections for the general public, researchers, scholars, other cultural professionals,
brands, media, and any other interested parties.

Currently, the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard includes a basic metadata extension, which optionally provides functions
for identifying NFT collections ("name" and "symbol") and attributes for representing assets ("name," "description,"
and "image"). However, to provide comprehensive context and substantiate the value of tokenized assets, NFT issuers
often create their own metadata structures. We believe that the basic extension alone is insufficient to capture the
context and significance of cultural and historical assets. The lack of interoperable and consistent rich metadata
hinders users' ability to search, discover, and connect tokenized assets on the blockchain. While connectivity among
collections may not be crucial for NFTs designed for games and memberships, it is of utmost importance for cultural and
historical assets. As the number and diversity of tokenized assets on the blockchain increase, it becomes essential to
establish a consistent and comprehensive metadata structure that provides context, substantiates value, and enables
connected search and discovery at scale.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

This EIP extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) with 48 additional properties to capture the
cultural and historical significance of the underlying asset.

Compatible contracts, besides implementing the relevant metadata schemas ("Metadata JSON Schema" for
[ERC-721](./eip-721.md) contracts or "Metadata URI JSON Schema" for [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) contracts), must implement
the following metadata interface.

### Cultural and Historical Asset Metadata Extension TypeScript Interface

The following TypeScript interface defines the Metadata JSON Schema compatible tokens must conform to:

## Rationale

### Choosing to Extend Off-Chain Metadata JSON Schema over On-Chain Interface

Both the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) provide natural extension points in the metadata JSON
file associated with NFTs to supply enriched datasets about the underlying assets.

Providing enriched datasets through off-chain metadata JSON files allows existing NFT contracts to adopt the new
metadata structure proposed in this EIP without upgrading or migrating. The off-chain design enables flexible and
progressive enhancement of any NFT collections to adopt this standard gradually. This approach allows NFT collections to
be deployed using already-audited and battle-tested smart contract code without creating or adapting new smart
contracts, reducing the risk associated with adopting and implementing a new standard.

### Capturing Attributes Extensions in `attributes` and `attributesExt` properties

In the design of the Cultural and Historical Asset Token (CHAT) metadata extension, we have made a deliberate choice to
capture the metadata attributes between two main properties: `attributes` and `attributesExt`. This division serves
two distinct purposes while ensuring maximum compatibility with existing NFT galleries and marketplaces.

**1. `attributes` Property**

The `attributes` property contains core metadata attributes that are integral to the identity and categorization of
CHATs. These attributes are meant to be readily accessible, displayed, and searchable by NFT galleries and marketplaces.
By placing fundamental details such as the CHAT's name, description, image, and other key characteristics
in `attributes`, we ensure that these essential elements can be easily presented to users, collectors, and researchers.
This approach allows CHATs to seamlessly integrate with existing NFT platforms and marketplaces without requiring major
modifications.

**2. `attributesExt` Property**

The `attributesExt` property, on the other hand, is dedicated to extended attributes that provide valuable, in-depth
information about a CHAT but are not typically intended for display or search within NFT galleries and marketplaces.
These extended attributes serve purposes such as archival documentation, provenance records, and additional context that
may not be immediately relevant to a casual observer or collector. By isolating these extended attributes
in `attributesExt`, we strike a balance between comprehensiveness and user-friendliness. This approach allows CHAT
creators to include rich historical and contextual data without overwhelming the typical user interface, making the
extended information available for scholarly or specialized use cases.

This division of attributes into `attributes` and `attributesExt` ensures that the CHAT standard remains highly
compatible with existing NFT ecosystems, while still accommodating the specific needs of cultural and historical assets.
Users can enjoy a seamless experience in browsing and collecting CHATs, while researchers and historians have access to
comprehensive information when required, all within a framework that respects the practicalities of both user interfaces
and extended data documentation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully backward compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md).

## Security Considerations

NFT platforms and systems working with Cultural and Historical Asset Metadata JSON files are recommended to treat the
files as client-supplied data and follow the appropriate best practices for processing such data.

Specifically, when processing the URI fields, backend systems should take extra care to prevent a malicious issuer from
exploiting these fields to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

Frontend or client-side systems are recommended to escape all control characters that may be exploited to perform
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Processing systems should manage resource allocation to prevent the systems from being vulnerable to Denial of Service (
DOS) attacks or circumventing security protection through arbitrary code exceptions. Improper processing of variable
data, such as strings, arrays, and JSON objects, may result in a buffer overflow. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate
resources carefully to avoid such vulnerabilities.

The metadata JSON files and the digital resources representing both the token and underlying assets should be stored in
a decentralized storage network to preserve the integrity and to ensure the availability of data for long-term
preservation.

Establishing the authenticity of the claims made in the Metadata JSON file is beyond the scope of this EIP, and is left
to future EIPs to propose an appropriate protocol.

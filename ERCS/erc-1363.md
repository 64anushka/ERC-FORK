## Abstract

This proposal defines an extension interface for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens that supports executing code on a recipient contract after transfers, or code on a spender contract after approvals, in a single transaction.

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens interaction with smart contracts after `transfer`, `transferFrom` or `approve`.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party, and then make a callback on the receiver or spender contract.

The following are functions and callbacks introduced by this EIP:

* `transferAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` will call an `onTransferReceived` on a `ERC1363Receiver` contract.
* `approveAndCall` will call an `onApprovalReceived` on a `ERC1363Spender` contract.

## Motivation

There is no way to execute code on a receiver/spender contract after an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) `transfer`, `transferFrom` or `approve` so, to perform an action, it is required to send another transaction.
This introduces complexity in UI development and friction on adoption as users must wait for the first transaction to be executed and then submit the second one. They must also pay GAS twice.

This proposal aims to make tokens capable of performing actions more easily and working without the use of any off-chain listener.
It allows to make a callback on a receiver/spender contract, after a transfer or an approval, in a single transaction.

Tokens defined by this EIP can be used for specific utilities in all cases that require a callback to be executed after a transfer or an approval received.
This EIP is also useful for avoiding token loss or token locking in contracts by verifying the recipient contract's ability to handle tokens.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Smart contracts implementing the [ERC-1363](./eip-1363.md) standard **MUST** implement all of the functions in the `ERC1363` interface, as well as the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) interfaces.

A contract that wants to accept ERC-1363 tokens via `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` **MUST** implement the `ERC1363Receiver` interface:

```solidity
/**
 * @title ERC1363Receiver
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` from ERC-1363 token contracts.
 */
interface ERC1363Receiver {
    /**
     * @dev Whenever ERC-1363 tokens are transferred to this contract via `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall`
     * by `operator` from `from`, this function is called.
     *
     * NOTE: To accept the transfer, this must return
     * `bytes4(keccak256("onTransferReceived(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))`
     * (i.e. 0x88a7ca5c, or its own function selector).
     *
     * @param operator The address which called `transferAndCall` or `transferFromAndCall` function.
     * @param from The address which are tokens transferred from.
     * @param value The amount of tokens transferred.
     * @param data Additional data with no specified format.
     * @return `bytes4(keccak256("onTransferReceived(address,address,uint256,bytes)"))` if transfer is allowed unless throwing.
     */
    function onTransferReceived(address operator, address from, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) external returns (bytes4);
}
``` 

A contract that wants to accept ERC-1363 tokens via `approveAndCall` **MUST** implement the `ERC1363Spender` interface:

```solidity
/**
 * @title ERC1363Spender
 * @dev Interface for any contract that wants to support `approveAndCall` from ERC-1363 token contracts.
 */
interface ERC1363Spender {
    /**
     * @dev Whenever an ERC-1363 tokens `owner` approved this contract via `approveAndCall`
     * to spent their tokens, this function is called.
     *
     * NOTE: To accept the approval, this must return
     * `bytes4(keccak256("onApprovalReceived(address,uint256,bytes)"))`
     * (i.e. 0x7b04a2d0, or its own function selector).
     *
     * @param owner The address which called `approveAndCall` function and previously owned the tokens.
     * @param value The amount of tokens to be spent.
     * @param data Additional data with no specified format.
     * @return `bytes4(keccak256("onApprovalReceived(address,uint256,bytes)"))` if approval is allowed unless throwing.

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that can accept [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) callbacks.

Examples could be:

* creating a token payable crowdsale
* selling services for tokens
* paying invoices
* making subscriptions

For these reasons it was originally named **"Payable Token"**.

The choice to use `transferAndCall`, `transferFromAndCall` and `approveAndCall` derives from the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) naming.
They want to highlight that they have the same behaviors of `transfer`, `transferFrom` and `approve` with the addition of a callback on receiver or spender contracts.

`ERC1363Receiver` and `ERC1363Spender` were inspired by the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) `ERC721TokenReceiver` behavior.

## Backwards Compatibility

Unlike other [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) extension proposals, ERC-1363 doesn't override the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) `transfer` and `transferFrom` methods and defines the interfaces IDs to be implemented maintaining backward compatibility with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).

## Security Considerations

The `approveAndCall` and `transferFromAndCall` methods can be affected by the same issue of the standard [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) `approve` and `transferFrom` method.
Changing an allowance with the `approveAndCall` methods brings the risk that someone may use both the old and the new allowance by unfortunate transaction ordering.

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spender's allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards.

## Abstract

This proposal aims to define a blockchain-based data asset access control mechanism, enabling effective management and control of access permissions to data assets. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, a decentralized and tamper-resistant authorization system can be established, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of data assets.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

- Data owners can manage the list of authorized users for accessing data.
- Authorization can be defined with start and end timestamps.
- Data owners can define the URI for off-chain data access, allowing authorized users to download data files.
- Functions are provided to verify whether specified users are authorized to access.
- Data owners can define the metadata URI for data, utilizing a JSON file to describe assets.

Implementers of this standard **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
interface ERC7626 {
    /** @dev Returns the address of the data owner.
     *  @return The address of the data owner.
     */
    function dataOwner() external view returns (address);

    /** @dev Checks whether a user is authorized to access the data at the current time.
     *  @param user The address of the user to check.
     *  @return True if the user is authorized; otherwise, false.
     */
    function isUserAuthorized(address user) external view returns (bool);

    /** @dev Grants access to a user for a specified time period.
     *  @param user The address of the user to grant access to.
     *  @param start The start time of the access period.
     *  @param end The end time of the access period.
     */
    function grantAccess(address user, uint256 start, uint256 end) external;

    /** @dev Revokes access of a user.
     *  @param user The address of the user to revoke access from.
     */
    function revokeAccess(address user) external;

    /** @dev Sets the new metadata URI.
     *  @param newURI The new metadata URI.
     */
    function setMetadataURI(string memory newURI) external;

    /** @dev Sets the new download URI.
     *  @param newURI The new download URI.
     */
    function setDownloadURI(string memory newURI) external;

    /** @dev Returns the metadata URI.
     *  @return The metadata URI.
     */
    function metadataURI() external view returns (string memory);

    /** @dev Returns the download URI.
     *  @return The download URI.
     */
    function downloadURI() external view returns (string memory);

    /** @dev Emitted when access is granted to a user.
     *  @param user The address of the user who was granted access.
     *  @param start The start time of the access period.
     *  @param end The end time of the access period.
     */
    event AccessGranted(address indexed user, uint256 start, uint256 end);

    /** @dev Emitted when access is revoked from a user.
     *  @param user The address of the user whose access was revoked.
     */
    event AccessRevoked(address indexed user);
}
```

#### Metadata URI JSON Schema

This is the "ERC7626 Metadata JSON Schema for `metadataURI()`" referenced above.

```json
{
  "name": "Example Asset",
  "description": "This is an example asset used for demonstration purposes.",
  "created_at": "2024-02-17T12:00:00Z",
  "owner": "John Doe",
  "license": "CC BY-SA 4.0",
  "download_uri": "https://example.com/download",
  "document_uri": "https://example.com/document",
  "files": [
    {
      "filename": "example_file1.txt",
      "hash": "0xabcdef1234567890"
    },
    {
      "filename": "example_file2.jpg",
      "hash": "0x1234567890abcdef"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Rationale

In many scenarios, effective management of data asset access is crucial to ensure that only authorized users can access data. Current solutions often rely on centralized permission management systems, which are susceptible to single points of failure and security risks. By adopting blockchain technology and smart contracts, a decentralized and immutable authorization mechanism can be established, addressing these limitations and enhancing data asset security.

## Reference Implementation

See [`ERC7622.sol`](../assets/eip-7626/contracts/ERC7626.sol).
See [`server.js`](../assets/eip-7626/server.js).

## Security Considerations

1. Implementing access control functions within smart contracts ensures that authorization logic is resistant to tampering, preventing unauthorized access to data assets. However, it's crucial to thoroughly test for vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks to prevent exploitation.

2. Time-based access restrictions help mitigate the risk of unauthorized access over time. However, precautions must be taken to address potential issues such as time manipulation attacks, ensuring that access remains restricted as intended.

3. Validating off-chain data access URIs with wallet signatures before querying on-chain authorization status enhances security by preventing unauthorized queries. Robust signature verification mechanisms are essential to prevent forgery or tampering.

4. Transparent metadata descriptions provide clarity and accountability for data assets, reducing the risk of misuse or tampering. Ensuring the integrity of metadata is critical to prevent misleading information or unauthorized access.

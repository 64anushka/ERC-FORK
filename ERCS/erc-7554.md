## Abstract

This standard defines an interface extending EIP-721 [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) to provide an easy and on-chain approach for discovery and query of benefits and perks attached to NFTs. The attached benefits are defined by a schema that is stored off-chain and with a set of events and functions on-chain to allow for querying and access to benefits data. The benefits can represent for example an ecommerce store coupon, an access to conference, or a discount on goods and services at a certain establishment. 

Each of the attached benefits is described through benefits metadata that will allow any third party to easily discover, query and verify the attached benefits and the criteria for redemption.

## Motivation

Over the last two years, multiple attempts were made to bring token gating to many settings whether in online shopping, IRL events and others. However, most of these were built as silos relying on proprietary solutions and data that is limited in use to a single vendor. Moreover, NFT collection owners are left out of this process since any third party can start attaching benefits and perks to NFTs in a certain collection to target and acquire customers from that community without any involvement of the NFT collection owner or any royalty to be offered to the creator.

This standard aims to provide the capability to attach and manage benefits attached to NFTs using on-chain functionality and with a standardized benefits metadata that will make it easy for 3rd parties such as marketplaces, aggregators and data analytics actors to collect that information.
 
The standard aims to specify an interface that will allow capturing the events triggered by attaching and disattaching benefits as well as the standard functions to allow querying all benefits attached to a single NFT or a collection.

The use of NFT token-gating and benefits attachment has already been considered in many applications like the adoption of Shopify of the token-gating concept that can open the doors for many use cases including for example an online store offering a discount for customers who own a specific NFT; an airdrop to be limited to only owners of NFTs from a certain collection; a restaurant can offer certain coupons and discounts to some holders, and many others. 

As mentioned above, the proliferation of token-gating and benefits attachment will mean that certain blue chip NFTs and collections with vibrant communities will be the target by many brands and businnesses to start utilizing that already established community and use it as an approach for customer acquisition. However, both NFT holders and creators are left outside of this equation, since most of that will be taking place in silo gated environments in which data related to the benefits will be proprietary data and managed by token gating platforms owned by brands and businesses. Therefore, this standard aims at defining the interfaces in terms of functions and events that extends [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) to provide the complete functionality to manage those benefits and define the metadata standard that will allow an easy way to aggregate and query those benefits and their attributes.

The suggested approach will offer creators more capability to manage the community expectation and also allow holders to discover easily what types of benefits are available for the NFTs they hold. For example, a brand through certain analytics can identify a certain blue chip collection community as a fit for their campaign for a new product or service and start attaching benefits but that will need to be approved and handled by the collection creator. Let's assume the case of VIP access to an airport lounge, the brand will aim to acquire those customers that belong to the collection community while the creator has no interaction at all. Also, the NFTs holders might not be easily able to identify the actual attached benefits value for the tokens they hold based on the different benefits attached to the NFT since that data is in scattered in silos and might be kept private by each entity.

Therefore, this standard proposes a set of interfaces that can allow creators to manage or approve the NFTs benefits attachment and to allow for easy discovery and verifiability of those benefits by the different entities invloved. 


## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Every contract complying with this standard MUST implement the `IERC7554` interface. The **NFT Benefits Attachment and benefits metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) contracts.

```

A contract implementing this standard MAY set a maximum number of benefits to be attached to any token in the collection, in that case the implementation should keep track of the total number of benefits attached to a single `tokenId` and this number MUST NOT be greater than the maximum number of benefits.

The contract owner MAY set the `attachBenefit` as payable to be able to collect fees in advance and on-chain from interested parties in attaching benefits to the collection tokens.

The `BenefitAttached` event MUST be emitted when `attachBenefit` is called.

The `BenefitUpdated` event MUST be emitted when `updateBenefit` is called.

The `BenefitRemoved` event MUST be emitted when `removeBenefit` is called.

The `supportsInterface` method MUST return `true` when called with `TBD`.


### Benefit Metadata Schema

As mentioned above, one of the main motivations behind this standard is to provide a standardized way on how to describe the benefits attached to any NFT. Below is the benefits schema which will be used to store the benefit metadata JSON object in the assigned benefit URI

```json

Here is another example for a free Ice Cream coupon that will be offered to NFT NYC attendees once they collect 4 NFTs from XYZ soft drink collection. There will be unlimited redemption, limited in time to the event date and also in the surrounding area of the venue.

```json

  "Description": "Free Ice cream coupon to be redeemed for collectors of XYZ Can NFTs",
  "imageURI": "https://xyz.com/images/nft-nyc-ice-cream.png",
  "type": "Coupon",
  "category": "Food", 
  "provider": {
    "name": "XYZ",
    "description": "Producer of soft drinks",
    "externalURL": "https://xyz.com/",
    "image": "https://www.xyz.com/images/logo.png"
  },
    "redemption_details": {

    }
  },
  "market_value": [
    {	
      "currency": "USD",
      "amount": "5"
    },
  ],
  "geofencing": {

    "coordinates": [
      {
        "latitude": "40.7582",
        "longitude": "-74.0016"
      },
      {
        "latitude": "40.7581",
        "longitude": "-74.0031"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Rationale

The standard aims at providing an approach that will allow easy discovery and query of NFTs attached benefits which can be utilized by marketplaces to allow easy way for querying the benefits and displaying it similar to how metadata is handled. This can be also helpful to NFT valuation tools that can add to their dataset another group of features which reflect real or estimated value of the benefit to help in pricing and assisting users with their investing decisions.

Furthermore, the approach suggested by the standard also aims to provide a mechanism to enhance liqudity availability in the NFT market, by allowing an open and standard way of attaching benefits to NFTs this can trigger more interest in certain new applications in NFT space. For example, NFT rentals will be one of the main platforms to be able to utilize the benefits metadata to enrich the offering for holders and users. An NFT with attached benefits that are reflecting real direct live expereince and with value can spur more interest in the NFT rental space. So, for the suggested example above of offering VIP lounge access in an airport for holders of BAYC NFTs, will offer those who are not in the vicinity of that area or who hold more than one to rent those NFTs and generate revenue from other sources than just a sale on the marketplace and without giving up the ownership of the NFT.

The other important reason for defining this standard is to allow collection owners to have control on the possible value driven from attaching benefits to NFTs in their collections, this is for now is left in the hands of brands and other third party platforms for e-commerce, loyalty and token-gating to extract this value and tap into the commmunity that the collection owner has built. This approach can also stem more interest from collection owners to continue building more their communities with the possiblity of building business relations with brands and thrid party platforms.

The collection owners in this case can be more incentivized to keep building a vibrant community with possible monetization scheme on these efforts, and that can also serve in increased valuation of the NFTs themselves.

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC can be fully compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) by adding the functions and events defined above which are not going to affect the original functionality of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) compatible contracts.

For already existing deployed [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) contracts, the collection owner can deploy a contract based on this standard that will provide the features mentioned in this standard, and to be able to define the original collection contract address this will require adding a function to query the contract address of the original collection.

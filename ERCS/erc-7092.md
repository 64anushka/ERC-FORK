## Abstract

This proposal introduces fixed-income financial bonds with key characteristics defined to facilitate bond issuance in the primary market and enable buying or selling bonds in the secondary market. The standard also provides cross-chain functionalities for bonds operations and management accross multiple blockchains.

## Motivation

Fixed-income instruments are a widely utilized asset class for corporations and other entities raising funds. However, transitioning to tokenized bonds is challenging due to existing standards like [ERC-3475](./erc-3475.md), which introduces unfamiliar concepts and leads to unnecessary gas consumption. Additionally, the lack of named variables like coupon, maturity date, and principal, makes it difficult to implement ERC-3475 since developers need to remember which metadata is assigned to each parameter.

## Specification

The key words "MUST," "MUST NOT," "REQUIRED," "SHALL," "SHALL NOT," "SHOULD," "SHOULD NOT," "RECOMMENDED," "NOT RECOMMENDED," "MAY," and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**Every contract compliant with this ERC MUST implement the following interface:**

### Optional Functions

The following functions are OPTIONAL. They MAY be used to improve the standard usability.

- The `currencyOfCoupon` SHOULD be implemented only if the currency used for coupon payment is different from the currency used to repay the principal
- The `couponType` MAY be employed to signify the interest rate that the issuer has committed to paying to investors, which may take various forms such as zero coupon, fixed rate, floating rate, and more.
- The `couponFrequency` refers to how often the bond pays interest to its bondholders, and is typically expressed in terms of time periods, such as: Annual, Semi-Annual, Quarterly, or Monthly.
- The `dayCountBasis` is used to calculate the accrued interest on a bond between two coupon payment dates or other specific periods. Some of the day count basis are: Actual/Actual, 30/360, Actual/360, Actual/365, or 30/365
- Batch functions like `batchApprove`, `batchTransfer`, and others are used to optimize and consolidate multiple operations into a single function call. This provides atomicity and optimizes gas usage

```solidity
    /**
    * @notice Returns the number of decimals used by the bond. For example, if it returns `10`, it means that the token amount MUST be multiplied by 10000000000 to get the standard representation.
    *
    * OPTIONAL - interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present. The method is used to improve usability.

## Rationale

The design of this ERC aims to simplify the migration to tokenized bonds by maintaining consistency with traditional bond standards. This approach allows fixed-income instruments to be represented as on-chain tokens, manageable through wallets, and utilized by applications like decentralized exchanges, while avoiding the complexities and inefficiencies associated with other standards. This ERC facilitates the creation of new bond tokens with characteristics akin to traditional bonds, enhancing accessibility, liquidity, and cost-efficiency in bond trading and management.

The use of traditional finance terminology, like `issueVolume` and `principalOf`, is aimed at maintaining consistency with traditional bond language, which eases the adaptation for traditional entities.

### Total Supply and Account Balance

The `totalSupply` and `balanceOf` functions are not defined as they can be derived from `issueVolume` and `principalOf`, and `denomination`. However, it's RECOMMENDED to define these functions in any contract implementing this standard, ensuring the proper relationship between these values.

```javascript
    let totalSupply = issueVolume / denomination;

    function balance0f(account) {
        return principal(account) / denomination;
    }
```

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC SHOULD NOT extend existing standards like [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) or [ERC-1155](./erc-1155.md) due to the absence of certain functions like `totalSupply` or `balanceOf`. A pure implementation of this standard is RECOMMENDED for issuing tokenized bonds, as any hybrid solution with other mentioned standards SHOULD fail.


## Reference Implementation

The complete Reference Implementation can be found [here](../assets/erc-7092/ERC7092.sol).

Bonds with embedded options like callable, puttable, or convertible bonds can be created by inheriting from the basic ERC-7092 that integrates the proposed interface.

### CALLABLE BONDS:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import 'ERC7092.sol';

contract ERC7092Callable is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW THE ISSUER TO CALL BONDS
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice call bonds owned by `_investor`
    *         MUST be called by the issuer only
    */
    function call(address _investor) public {
        require(_principals[_investor] > 0, "ERC7092Callable: ONLY_ISSUER");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Callable: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[_investor];
        _principals[_investor] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC HERE
    }
}
```

### PUTTABLE BONDS:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import 'ERC7092.sol';

contract ERC7092Puttable is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW INVESTORS TO PUT BONDS
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice put bonds
    *         MUST be called by investors who own bonds
    */
    function put() public {
        require(_principals[msg.sender] > 0, "ERC7092Puttable: ONLY_INVESTORS");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Puttable: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[msg.sender];
        _principals[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC
    }
}
```

### CONVERTIBLE BONDS:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import 'ERC7092.sol';

contract ERC7092Convertible is ERC7092 {
    // WRITE THE LOGIC TO ALLOW INVESTOR OR ISSUER TO CONVERT BONDS TO EQUITY
    // STATE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS NEEDED
    
    /**
    * @notice convert bonds to equity. Here we assumed that the investors must convert their bonds to equity
    *         Issuer can also convert invetsors bonds to equity.
    */
    function convert() public {
        require(_principals[msg.sender] > 0, "ERC7092Convertible: ONLY_INVESTORS");
        require(block.timestamp < _bond[bondISIN].maturityDate, "ERC7092Convertible: BOND_MATURED");
        
        uint256 principal =  _principals[msg.sender];
        _principals[msg.sender] = 0;
        
        // ADD LOGIC HERE
    }
}
```

### Identity Registry

This standard is designed specifically for tokenizing bonds. It does not inherently manage information pertaining to bondholders' identities. However, to enhance compliance with regulatory requirements and improve transparency, it is strongly RECOMMENDED to implement an identity registry to store the identity addresses of all authorized investors.

By maintaining an identity registry, issuers can ensure that bond tokens issued under the ERC-7092 standard are transferred only to registered and authorized entities. This practice aligns with regulatory compliance measures and provides a structured way to manage and verify the identity of bondholders. It also helps prevent unauthorized or non-compliant transfers of bond tokens.

## Security Considerations

Implementing this ERC requires careful consideration of security risks related to functions approving operators to manage owner's bonds and functions allowing bond transfers. Functions `transferAll` and `transferAllFrom` permit transferring the entire balance of an account, necessitating robust validation to ensure only the bond owner or approved accounts can call these functions.

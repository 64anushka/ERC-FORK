## Abstract

This standard extends the Web3 URL like `web3://` in [ERC-4804](./eip-4804.md) in auto mode to determine the MIME type of a link via additional query parameters.

## Motivation

Web3 URL defines a way to determine the MIME type of a link in auto mode via the suffix of the last argument.  However, most of existing contracts on Ethereum do not expect such suffix and thus the current Web3 URL cannot display the web contents on existing contracts in a correct way (e.g., rendering an SVG image rather than the XML text).  The standard proposes additional query parameters for a Web3 URL to determine the MIME type.

## Specification

The standard introduces three query parameters to determine the MIME type.

- `mime.content=<contentType>`, where `<contentType>` is a URL-encoded MIME type defined in RFC 6838. If the URL-decoded `<contentType>` does not follow the structure of a MIME type, an error is thrown. After URL decoding, `<contentType>` is set as the value of the `Content-Type` header of the response; or
- `mime.type=<fileType>`, where `<fileType>` is a filename extension from which a media type is determined. If the filename extension is not recognized, an error is thrown. The media type is then set as the value of the `Content-Type` header of the response; or
- `mime.dataurl=(true|false)`, which determines whether to decode the returned EVM data and set the MIME type according to data URL standard defined in RFC 2397.  If the data cannot be parsed as data URL, an error will be returned.
  
If multiple query parameters are present, the last query parameter will be applied.  If none of the query parameter is specified, `Content-Type` is defined by ERC-4804.  If `returns` query parameter is specified, the `mime.xxx` parameters will be ignored and the `Content-Type` will be set to `application/json`.
  
### Examples

#### Example 1

```
web3://0x91cf36c92feb5c11d3f5fe3e8b9e212f7472ec14/accessorizedImageOf/1289?mime.content=image%2Fsvg%2Bxml
```

where the contract is in auto mode.

The protocol will call the contract `0x91cf36c92feb5c11d3f5fe3e8b9e212f7472ec14` with the message defined in ERC-4804 and `Content-Type` is set to `image/svg+xml`.

#### Example 2

```
web3://0x91cf36c92feb5c11d3f5fe3e8b9e212f7472ec14/accessorizedImageOf/1289?mime.type=svg
```

where the contract is in auto mode.

The protocol will call the contract `0x91cf36c92feb5c11d3f5fe3e8b9e212f7472ec14` with the message defined in ERC-4804 and `Content-Type` is set to `image/svg+xml`.

#### Example 3

```
web3://0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7/tokenURI/100?mime.dataurl=true
```

where the contract is in auto mode, and the returned data is `data:application/json;base64,...`.

The protocol will call the contract `0xff9c1b15b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7` with the message defined in ERC-4804 and decode the data according to data URL standard, which sets `Content-Type` to `application/json`,

## Rationale

The standard uses three different query parameters rather than a single query paramter to avoid confusion - an implementer or a user can easily tell the expected returned MIME of a link.  Further, in auto mode, the query parameters are not used to form the EVM message (e.g., calldata) and thus it is safe to introduce new query parameters.

## Abstract

[ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) is a proposed token standard that extends [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) and combines its functionality with other existing token standards, introducing unique features for interoperability, cross-chain operation, and token wrapping. The standard aims to provide a flexible and efficient solution for managing real-asset security tokens. At its core, [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) introduces the concept of partitions, where each `tokenId` represents a distinct partition. A partition can have its own set of rights and privileges, making it suitable for various use cases, including but not limited to semi-fungible asset management.

One of the significant use cases of [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) is semi-fungible asset management, enabling the representation of different fractional ownership units within a single token. This facilitates the fractionalization of assets, allowing investors to own smaller portions of high-value assets. However, it is essential to note that `tokenId` can represent various partitions, each serving different purposes beyond share classes.

[ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) addresses the need for enhanced cross-chain interoperability and flexible compliance management in the rapidly evolving landscape of security tokens. By leveraging the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) standard, security tokens can seamlessly interact with the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) ecosystem, enabling trustless transfers and integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.

## Motivation

The [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) standard addresses the increasing demand for interoperability and compliance management within the security token ecosystem. Leveraging the strengths of established token standards like [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md), and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) presents a comprehensive token framework that enables seamless interaction between security tokens and the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) ecosystem. This heightened interoperability allows for trustless transfers and integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, ensuring security tokens comply effortlessly with diverse regulatory requirements across various jurisdictions.

* Cross-chain

  As the blockchain landscape evolves, cross-chain interoperability gains importance. [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) tackles this challenge by introducing features enabling security tokens to operate across multiple blockchain networks. This cross-chain functionality facilitates the seamless transfer and interaction of security tokens between blockchains, enhancing their versatility and accessibility in decentralized ecosystems. By transcending the limitations of a single blockchain, [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) opens up new possibilities for security tokens, tapping into the potential of the broader blockchain universe.

* Partition

  A unique aspect of [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) is its semi-fungible partition management feature. Leveraging the tokenId functionality of [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md), [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) allows each tokenId to represent a unique semi-fungible partition. Token issuers can create and manage diverse partitions, each with its own set of rights and privileges. This feature benefits security tokens representing real-world assets, allowing the tokenization of complex financial instruments with multiple partitions. Enhanced partition management empowers token issuers to offer tailored investment options, catering to the unique preferences of investors in the security token ecosystem.
  
* Interoperability

  [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) introduces token wrapping functionality, enabling security tokens to be represented on other blockchain networks and integrated with DeFi platforms. This unlocks new liquidity and financial service opportunities, bridging traditional finance with decentralized finance. The integration of security tokens with DeFi platforms expands asset tokenization and financial innovation, contributing to the growth of the DeFi sector. In summary, [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md)'s comprehensive features enhance the potential of security tokens and drive the evolution of the security token ecosystem.

### Interoperability

[ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) facilitates interoperability with [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) tokens through a token wrapping method. The process involves two key components: the [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) token contracts representing the original and the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) token contract for the wrapped version. Users seeking to wrap their tokens interact with the wrapping contract, which securely locks their original tokens and mints an equivalent amount of [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) tokens to their address. Conversely, unwrapping is achieved by calling the contract's withdraw function, resulting in the burning of [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) tokens and the release of the corresponding original tokens. Events are emitted for transparency, and robust security measures are implemented to safeguard user assets and address any potential vulnerabilities in the contract code. With this design, [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) ensures the seamless conversion and compatibility with [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) tokens, promoting greater utility and usability across the Ethereum ecosystem.

### Use case diagram

![image](../assets/erc-7518/plantumlusecase.png)

Actor:

* Issuer : creates and releases tokens on a blockchain. They ensure compliance, manage token offerings, track ownership, and maintain token functionality and governance.
* Investor : individual or entity that participates in investment opportunities involving tokens on a blockchain or distributed ledger. These investors allocate capital to purchase or acquire tokens with the expectation of generating a return on their investment.
* Transfer Agent: intermediary between buyers and sellers of tokens. They help facilitate transactions by connecting investors or token holders with liquidity providers or other participants in the market and provide liquidity to the market by maintaining an inventory of tokens and offering competitive bid and ask prices.

Core Functions:

* mint: minting tokens by the issuer.
* burn: burning tokens by the issuer.
* isRestricted: condition check to determine if the token is not restricted.
* canTransfer: checking if a transfer is allowed.
* isRestricted : A condition representing the check for whether the token is not restricted.
* on-chain: performing a verification steps for token restrictions, frozen accounts, transferable balances, and token locking.
* transfer: transferring tokens by the investor.
* force transfer: forcing a transfer by the transfer agent.
* payout: performing payouts by the issuer.
* freeze account: freezing an account by the transfer agent.

### Real-World Example

![image](../assets/erc-7518/exampleUsecase.png)

* Dynamic Pricing: With [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens representing different floors of the hotel, the token issuer can implement dynamic pricing strategies. As demand fluctuates, the prices of tokens for each floor can be adjusted accordingly. Premium amenities, floor popularity, and seasonal variations can all be factored into the pricing model. This dynamic pricing mechanism ensures that token values accurately reflect the current market conditions and the perceived value of each floor.
* Designated Payouts: Each token class (e.g., "Class A," "Class B," "Class C") can have its own designated payout structure. Token holders are entitled to receive payouts based on the revenue generated by the specific partition represented by their tokens. This means that token holders owning "Class A" tokens for Floor 1 will receive payouts corresponding to the revenue generated by Floor 1, "Class B" tokens for Floor 2 will receive payouts according to the revenue of Floor 2, and so on.
* Complex Revenue Sharing: By customizing revenue-sharing percentages for different token classes, the hotel can implement more intricate revenue-sharing models. For example, "Class A" tokens might have a higher revenue-sharing percentage due to the premium amenities and high demand on Floor 1, while "Class C" tokens for Floor 3, representing fractional ownership, might have a lower revenue-sharing percentage.
* Optimized Revenue Distribution: By strategically adjusting the payout structures for various partitions, the hotel can optimize revenue distribution among token holders. This approach ensures that investors with tokens representing more desirable floors or premium features receive a greater share of the revenue, while still providing value to holders of tokens for less popular or less lucrative partitions.
* Incentivizing Investments: Different revenue-sharing arrangements for token classes can incentivize investors to acquire tokens for specific floors. If a particular floor is expected to have higher revenue potential in the future, the corresponding tokens may attract more investments due to their attractive payout structure.
* Catering to Stakeholder Preferences: The ability to create multiple token classes, each with its own unique payout structure, allows the hotel to cater to the diverse preferences of stakeholders. Some investors might be interested in higher-risk, higher-reward investments (e.g., "Class A" tokens), while others might prefer more conservative options (e.g., "Class C" tokens).

By combining dynamic pricing, designated payouts, complex revenue sharing, optimized revenue distribution, incentivized investments, and stakeholder catering, the hotel can create a versatile and attractive investment opportunity that appeals to a broad range of investors. Moreover, the transparency and immutability of blockchain-based [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens ensure a secure and trustless system for managing ownership, access, and revenue-sharing rights within the hotel's ecosystem.

### Transfer Flow

The transfer flow in the proposed EIP consists of two main parts off-chain and on-chain.

* Client: Represents the client or user initiating the transfer. It interacts with the backend and the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract.
* Backend: Refers to the backend system responsible for handling requests from the client and performing off-chain verification.
* [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md): Represents the smart contract that implements the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) security standard. It receives transfer requests and interacts with the compliance contract for verification.
* Compliance: Responsible for performing verification checks. It verifies the transfer's validity based on various factors such as off-chain verification, custom rules, regulations, and signature validation.

 end

 ERC-7518-->>-Client: status
```

#### Off-chain

  1. The sequence begins with the Client initiating a request to the Backend by sending a post request to the backend, upon receiving the request, the Backend performs several verification checks. These include verifying the KYC (Know Your Customer), regulation exemptions, jurisdiction requirements, and performing manual verification if necessary.
  2. Once the Backend completes the verification process, it generates a signature based on EIP-712 method.

#### On-chain

  1. Involves the client invoking the `safeTransferFrom` function within the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract, supplying the necessary transfer information. Subsequently, this function triggers the `canTransfer` function, which assesses whether the transfer is permissible. The specific approach may vary, with the function either communicating with another contract or performing internal checks to make this determination.
  2. [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) internally call `verifyTransfer` method on the `Compliance` with or without signature. Based on the client preference the mode of verification could be off-chain(signature based) or on-chain(rule based smart contract).
  3. The [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract forwards the transfer request along with the signature to the Compliance contract for further verification. If off-chain verification is enabled, the Compliance contract validates the signature using the `isSignatureValid` function. If the signature is found to be valid, the Compliance contract sends the verification status (true) back to the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract.
  4. If the signature is missing or invalid, the Compliance contract performs additional validation checks based on the provided hash and signature using the validateOff-chain transfer function. The details of this additional validation process are not shown in the diagram.
  5. The `Compliance` contract returns the verification status (true/false) to the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract.
  6. Finally, the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) contract relays the verification status back to the client, indicating whether the transfer is approved or rejected.

## Rationale

* Building upon Existing Token Standards:

  [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) extends and combines the functionalities of existing token standards like [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md), addressing the unique requirements of security tokens, such as cross-chain interoperability, flexible compliance management, and token wrapping.
* Enhancing Interoperability and Compliance Management:

  [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) introduces unique features for cross-chain operations, semi-fungible share class management, and seamless interaction with the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) ecosystem. It also provides a comprehensive compliance model for both on-chain and off-chain verification, ensuring adherence to various regulatory requirements and jurisdictional restrictions.

## Backwards Compatibility

* Semi-fungible share class management: [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) supports the management of semi-fungible share classes, providing flexibility in the representation of ownership and fractional shares of real-world assets.
* Token wrapping: [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) introduces token wrapping functionality, enabling the conversion of tokens from one standard to another, further enhancing interoperability and integration with various blockchain networks.
* Flexible compliance management: [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) offers a comprehensive compliance management solution, including off-chain verification, custom rules, regulations, and signature validation. This ensures that security tokens adhere to the necessary regulatory requirements while maintaining a high level of flexibility.
* Hard Asset such as Commercial Tower: [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) can be used to tokenize a commercial tower, allowing investors to own a fraction of the asset. Each `tokenId` can represent a unique share class, such as a percentage of the entire tower or individual floors. This enables greater liquidity and accessibility to real estate investments, as smaller investors can participate in owning a portion of a large commercial property
* Soft Asset such as Funds: [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) can be used to tokenize funds, especially in a Fund of Funds (FoF) business model. Each sub-fund within the FoF can be tokenized, with each `tokenId` representing a unique share class. This allows investors to directly invest in specific sectors, regions, or strategies based on their preferences. The semi-fungible share class management feature of [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) provides the flexibility to create and manage multiple share classes with varying rights and privileges.

By incorporating these additional features, [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) addresses the growing need for enhanced cross-chain interoperability and flexible compliance management in the rapidly evolving landscape of security tokens. This makes [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) a powerful and versatile token standard for the security token ecosystem.

## Security Considerations

1. Access Control Measures

   To ensure the security and integrity of the [ERC-7518](./eip-7518.md) token standard, it is crucial to implement proper access control measures. Access control measures should be in place to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive functions such as `lockTokens`, `forceTransfer`, `freezeAddress`, and `unFreeze`. This can be achieved by using role-based access control (RBAC) or other access control mechanisms to limit the capabilities of different entities interacting with the smart contract.
2. Input Validation

   Input validation is essential to prevent potential vulnerabilities and unauthorized actions. Functions such as `canTransfer`, `lockTokens`, and `forceTransfer` should validate input parameters to ensure they meet the required criteria. For example, checking if the `to` and `from` addresses are not frozen, ensuring the `amount` is within the transferable balance, and validating the `releaseTime` for locked tokens.
3. Secure Storage and Handling of Release Times

   When locking tokens using the `lockTokens` function, it is important to securely store and handle the release times. This can be achieved by storing the release times in a secure data structure within the smart contract and ensuring that locked tokens are only released after the designated time has passed. Proper handling of release times helps prevent unauthorized access to locked tokens and ensures the integrity of the token locking mechanism.

## Abstract

This extension defines an interface that adds balance functionalities to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens, enabling functions and events for balance querying, transfer, and approval akin to [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens.

## Motivation

Some NFTs require defining shares of a corresponding right for each token, such as ownership stakes in a company. Each token holder can be considered a shareholder of this right and they wish to be able to conveniently query and trade these shares. However, the current [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard lacks built-in support for token balances, leading to difficulties and limitations in managing and trading these rights. By introducing balance functionalities akin to [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), we can provide a universal solution for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens, enabling holders to easily query and trade their corresponding shares of rights, thereby fostering broader adoption and circulation of NFTs.

## Specification

Implementers of this extension **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC7628 {
    /// @notice Returns the number of decimal places used for token balances.
    /// @return The number of decimal places.
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);

    /// @notice Returns the total sum of token balances in existence.
    /// @return The total sum of balances for all tokens.
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Returns the balance of the specified token.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @return The balance of the token.
    function balanceOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Returns the allowance granted to the specified spender by the owner for the specified token.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @param spender The address of the spender.
    /// @return The allowance granted to the spender.
    function allowance(uint256 tokenId, address spender) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Approves the specified address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @param to The address of the spender.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to approve.
    function approve(uint256 tokenId, address to, uint256 amount) external;

    /// @notice Transfers tokens from the balance of one token to another.
    /// @param _fromTokenId The identifier of the sender token.
    /// @param _toTokenId The identifier of the recipient token.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.
    function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 amount) external;

    /// @notice Emitted when tokens are transferred from the balance of one token to another.
    /// @param _fromTokenId The identifier of the sender token.
    /// @param _toTokenId The identifier of the recipient token.
    /// @param value The amount of tokens transferred.
    event Transfer(uint256 indexed _fromTokenId, uint256 indexed _toTokenId, uint256 value);

    /// @notice Emitted when an approval is granted for a spender to spend tokens on behalf of an owner.
    /// @param _tokenId The token identifier.
    /// @param spender The address of the spender.
    /// @param value The amount of tokens approved.
    event Approval(uint256 indexed _tokenId, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
```

## Rationale

The removal of the `transfer` function from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) is due to the necessity of using `tokenId` for transfers. Including it would result in redundancy with the `transferFrom` function.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) compatible.

## Abstract

This extension defines an interface that adds balance functionalities to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens, enabling functions and events for balance querying, transfer, and approval akin to [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens.

## Motivation

Some NFTs represent divisible ownership stakes or shares of associated rights, such as those pertaining to digital assets, real estate, or intellectual property. The ability to accurately query and exchange these shares is crucial for facilitating efficient market operations. However, the absence of built-in support for token balances within the current [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard poses challenges and limitations in managing and trading these rights effectively. By introducing functionalities that mirror those of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token balances, we can offer a comprehensive solution for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens. This enhancement empowers holders to effortlessly inquire about and exchange their respective ownership shares, thereby promoting wider acceptance and circulation of NFTs.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Implementers of this extension **MUST** have all of the following functions:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC7628 /* is IERC721 */ {
    /// @notice Returns the number of decimal places used for token balances.
    /// @return The number of decimal places.
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);

    /// @notice Returns the total sum of token balances in existence.
    /// @return The total sum of balances for all tokens.
    function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Returns the balance of the specified token.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @return The balance of the token.
    function balanceOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Returns the allowance granted to the specified spender by the owner for the specified token.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @param spender The address of the spender.
    /// @return The allowance granted to the spender.
    function allowance(uint256 tokenId, address spender) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Approves the specified address to spend the specified amount of tokens on behalf of the caller.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the token.
    /// @param to The address of the spender.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to approve.
    function approve(uint256 tokenId, address to, uint256 amount) external;

    /// @notice Transfers tokens from the balance of one token to another.
    /// @param _fromTokenId The identifier of the sender token.
    /// @param _toTokenId The identifier of the recipient token.
    /// @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.
    function transferFrom(uint256 _fromTokenId, uint256 _toTokenId, uint256 amount) external;

    /// @notice Emitted when tokens are transferred from the balance of one token to another.
    /// @param _fromTokenId The identifier of the sender token.
    /// @param _toTokenId The identifier of the recipient token.
    /// @param value The amount of tokens transferred.
    event Transfer(uint256 indexed _fromTokenId, uint256 indexed _toTokenId, uint256 value);

    /// @notice Emitted when an approval is granted for a spender to spend tokens on behalf of an owner.
    /// @param _tokenId The token identifier.
    /// @param spender The address of the spender.
    /// @param value The amount of tokens approved.
    event Approval(uint256 indexed _tokenId, address indexed spender, uint256 value);
}
```

## Rationale

By adding a balance attribute to each token and adopting mechanisms similar to [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), we can facilitate the transfer of balances between tokens. This enables holders to conveniently query and trade their respective ownership shares. Additionally, we can choose to mint NFTs to increase balance if needed. The removal of the `transfer` function from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) is due to the necessity of using `tokenId` for transfers. Including it would result in redundancy with the `transferFrom` function.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) compatible.

## Abstract

This specification defines the minimum interface required to temporarily approve `ERC-20` tokens for spending within a single transaction.

## Motivation

`EIP-1153` allows to use a cheaper way to temporarily store allowances.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "SHOULD", "MAY" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Compliant contracts MUST implement 1 new function in addition to `ERC-20`:
```solidity
function temporaryApprove(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool success)
```
Call to `temporaryApprove(spender, value)` allows `spender` to withdraw within the same transaction from `msg.sender` multiple times, up to the `value` amount.

The storage for the temporary allowances MUST be different to that of the regular allowance. Compliant contracts MAY use the transient storage `EIP-1153` to keep the temporary allowance. For each `owner` and `spender`, the slot MUST be uniquely selected to avoid slot collision. Each slot index SHOULD be derived from the base slot index for temporary allowances, `owner` and `spender` addresses. Slot MAY be derived as `keccak256(spender . keccak256(owner . p))` where `.` is concatenation and `p` is `keccak256` from the string uniquely defining temporary allowances in the namespace of the implementing contract.

Compliant contracts MUST add a temporary allowance check to the `transferFrom` function. The permanent allowance SHOULD only be spent after the temporary allowance has been exhausted.

Compliant contracts MUST add a temporary allowance to the permanent one when returning the allowed amount to spend in the `allowance` function. In case the sum of the temporary and permanent allowance overflow, `type(uint256).max` MUST be returned.

No event is required when setting a temporary allowance, but compliant contracts MAY implement it.

## Rationale

The main goal of this standard is to make it cheaper to approve `ERC-20` tokens for a single transaction with minimal interface extension to allow easier integration of a compliant contract into existing infrastructure. This affects the backward compatibility of the `allowance` function. However, the required changes to the `transferFrom` function implementation satisfy the requirement to explicitly authorize the spender to transfer tokens.

## Backwards Compatibility

All functionality of the `ERC-20` standard is backward compatible except for the `allowance` function.

## Reference Implementation

TBD

## Security Considerations

The method of deriving slot identifiers to store temporary allowances must avoid collision with other slots in the same space (e.g. transient storage).

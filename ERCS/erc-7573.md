## Abstract

The interfaces in this proposal model a functional transaction scheme to establish a secure *delivery-versus-payment*
across two blockchains, where a) no intermediary is required and b) one of the two chains
can securely interact with a stateless "decryption oracle". Here, *delivery-versus-payment* refers to the exchange of,
e.g., an asset against a payment, however, the concept is generic to make a transfer of one token on one
chain (e.g., the payment) conditional to the successful transfer of another token on another chain (e.g., the asset).

The scheme is realized by two smart contracts, one on each chain.
One smart contract implements the `ILockingContract` interface on one chain (e.g. the "asset chain"), and another smart contract implements the `IDecryptionContract` interface on the other chain (e.g., the "payment chain").
The smart contract implementing `ILockingContract` locks a token (e.g., the asset) on its chain until a key is presented that will encrypt to one of two given values.
The smart contract implementing `IDecryptionContract`, decrypts one of two keys (via the decryption oracle) conditional to the success or failure of the token transfer (e.g., the payment). For the decryption, a stateless decryption oracle is attached to the chain running `IDecryptionContract`.

## Motivation

Within the domain of financial transactions and distributed ledger technology (DLT), the Hash-Linked Contract (HLC) concept has been recognized as valuable and has been thoroughly investigated.
The concept may help to solve the challenge of delivery-versus-payment (DvP), especially in cases where the asset chain and payment system (which may be a chain, too) are separated. The proposed solutions are based on an API-based interaction mechanism which bridges the communication between a so-called Asset Chain and a corresponding Payment System or requires complex and problematic time-locks (\cite{BancaItalia}). We believe an even more lightweight interaction across both systems is possible, especially when the payment system is also based on a DLT infrastructure.

## Specification

### Methods

#### Smart Contract on one chain (e.g. the asset chain)

```solidity
interface ILockingContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id);
    event TransferConfirmed(address confirmer, bytes32 id);
    event TokenClaimed(bytes32 id, string key);
    event TokenReclaimed(bytes32 id, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSeller) external;
    function confirmTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedBuyer) external;
    function transferWithKey(bytes32 id, string memory key) external;
}
```

#### Smart Contract on the other chain (e.g. the payment chain)

```solidity
interface IDecryptionContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id, int amount);
    event TransferKeyRequested(bytes32 id, string encryptedKey);
    event TransferKeyReleased(bytes32 id, bool success, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
    function transferAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
    function cancelAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
}
```

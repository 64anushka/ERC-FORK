## Abstract

The interfaces model the functional transaction scheme to establish a secure delivery-versus-payment across two blockchains,
where a) no intermediary is required and b) the operator of the payment chain/payment system has a small overhead and does
not need to store state.
The main idea comes with two requirements: First, the payment chain operator hosts a stateless decryption service that allows
decrypting messages with his secret key. Second, a "Payment Contract" is deployed on the payment chain that implements a function
```solidity
function transferAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, address to, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
```
that processes the (trigger-based) payment and emits the decrypted key depending on the success or failure of the transaction. The respective key can then trigger an associated transaction, e.g. claiming delivery by the buyer or re-claiming the locked asset by the seller.

## Motivation

Within the domain of financial transactions and distributed ledger technology (DLT), the Hash-Linked Contract (HLC) concept has been recognized as valuable and has been thoroughly investigated.
The concept may help to solve the challenge of delivery-versus-payment (DvP), especially in cases where the asset chain and payment system (which may be a chain, too) are separated. The proposed solutions are based on an API-based interaction mechanism which bridges the communication between a so-called Asset Chain and a corresponding Payment System or require complex and problematic time-locks (\cite{BancaItalia}). We believe that an even more lightweight interaction across both systems is possible, especially when the payment system is also based on a DLT infrastructure.

## Specification

### Methods

#### Smart Contract on the Asset Chain

```solidity
interface ILockingContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id);
    event TransferConfirmed(address confirmer, bytes32 id);
    event TokenClaimed(bytes32 id, string key);
    event TokenReclaimed(bytes32 id, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSeller) external;
    function confirmTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedBuyer) external;
    function transferWithKey(bytes32 id, string memory key) external;
}
```

#### Smart Contract on the Payment Chain

```solidity
interface IDecryptionContract {
    event TransferIncepted(address initiator, bytes32 id, int amount);
    event TransferKeyRequested(bytes32 id, string encryptedKey);
    event TransferKeyReleased(bytes32 id, bool success, string key);

    function inceptTransfer(bytes32 id, int amount, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
    function transferAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, int amount, address to, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
    function cancelAndDecrypt(bytes32 id, address from, string memory keyEncryptedSuccess, string memory keyEncryptedFailure) external;
}
```

## Test Cases

As there is no reference implementation, there are no test cases.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation is currently not provided. It may be added in a later phase.

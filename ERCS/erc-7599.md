## Abstract

The proposal defines a set of standards for upgrading non-fungible tokens to on-chain AI Agent Account and specifying their interaction mechanisms. These AI Agent Accounts allow interaction with other smart contracts and off-chain applications.

## Motivation

Defining standards for on-chain AI Agent Account paves the path for a democratized human-AI collaborative society, allows for creations of AI data as a new class of asset, and treating each of the AI Agent Account as an autonomous yield-generating entity. Because it is compatible with ERC-6551 protocol, AI Agent Account is also an Ethereum Account. At the same time, many scenarios can be extended by defining `abilityURI`, interaction processes, and interfaces in AI Agent Account. Here are some examples of scenarios:

- abilityURI links to a prompt: Users can chat with an AI Agent Account or ask an AI Agent Account to help draw a picture and mint it into an NFT.
- abilityURI links to a langchain task: Users can ask an AI Agent Account to help with complex tasks.
- abilityURI links to an ML algorithm: Let an AI Agent Account predict token prices or the weather

An AI Agent Account must also define its interaction interface, and based on business requirements, this interface can be implemented for payment, whitelist, or qualification interactions, according to permission controls.

## Overview

The system extends the definition of Account in ERC-6551, which mainly includes:

1. Add an `abilityURI` method, whose content may be an IPFS or s3 link, and the link content may be a prompt or a snippet of langchain code.
2. Define an interface for how other contracts or external accounts interact with an AI Agent Account.
3. Define an interface for receiving off-chain AI computation results.

The following diagram shows how the protocol works:

![../assets/erc-7599/arch.png](Arch)

1. The off-chain AI Agent service gets the `abilityURL` through function `abilityURI()`, and then downloads the prompt or a snippet of langchain code through `abilityURL`.
2. Other smart contracts or users request on-chain AI Agent jobs by invoking `requestAgent` function with user input as a parameter and the AI Agent Account emits the `AgentRequested` event.
3. Off-chain AI Agent service listens to the `AgentRequested` event and invokes the AI model computation and then receives an execution response.
4. Off-chain AI Agent service returns the result through `handleAgentResponse`.
5. 
## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY” and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

We define the smart contract interface below:

- **AgentRequested**: This event emits when an AI Agent Account job is requested. The off-chain AI Agent service listens and performs requested tasks, and returns final results.
- **AbilityURIUpdated**: This event emits when the `abilityURL` is updated.
- **abilityURI()**: Gets the `abilityURI` for an AI Agent.
- **setAbilityURI()**: AI Agent Account’s creator/owner can update the `abilityURI`.
- **requestAgent()**: Passes user input as a function parameter and emits `AgentRequested` event. It can be customized and updated by an AI Agent Account’s creator/owner, such as setting it as a paid request.
- **handleAgentResponse()**: The result of the call is written through this method, and an index is required to ensure the order of the result.

```solidity
interface IERC7599 is IERC6551Account {
    /**
     * @notice This event emits when an on-chain AI Agent job is requested.
     */
    event AgentRequested(uint256 index, bytes input);

    /**
     * @notice This event emits when the abilityURL is updated.
     */
    event AbilityURIUpdated(string uri);

    /**
     * @notice Gets the abilityURI for an AI Agent.
     * @return The abilityURI
     */
    function abilityURI() external view returns(string memory);

    /**
     * @notice Update the abilityURI.
     */
    function setAbilityURI(string memory uri) external;

    /**
     * @notice Passes user input as a function parameter and emits AgentReq             uested event. 
     */
    function requestAgent(bytes memory input) payable external;

    /**
    * @notice The result of the call is written through this method, and an index is required to ensure the order of the result.
     */
    function handleAgentResponse(uint256 index, bytes response) external;
}
```

1. The smart contract implementing IERC7594 MUST implement IERC6551 Account.
2. The `AbilityURIUpdated` event MUST be emitted when the `abilityURI` is updated.
3. The `AgentRequested` event MUST be emitted when the `requestAgent` function is requested.


## Rationale

The key features of this proposal are:

1. Create a set of standards for AI Agent Account interaction interfaces and processes.
2. Upgrade AI Agent Account without changing any properties of NFTs by being compatible with the ERC-6551 protocol.
3. Project parties or developers can easily implement their own AI Agent Accounts, which brings many interesting scenarios.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with [ERC-6551](./erc-6551.md)

## Test Cases

Tests are included in [`ERC7599Tester.ts`](../assets/eip-7599/test/ERC7599Tester.ts).

To run them in terminal, you can use the following commands:

```
cd ../assets/erc-7599
pnpm install
npx hardhat test
```

## Reference Implementation

See [`SimpleERC7599Agent.sol`](../assets/erc-7599/contracts/SimpleERC7599Agent.sol).

## Security Considerations

Since AI Agent Accounts rely on an off-chain Agent service, the protocol does not provide any mechanism to guarantee user input privacy and verifications of the accessed off-chain computation services. Therefore, in order to receive fully verifiable and private computation, it is advised that off-chain Agent service should run on a decentralized computing network.
